# Free Share

Free Share is a website that allows people to send content (title, description, image) without creating an account. Users can send content to others by simply adding the recipient's email address. If the recipient does not have an account, the content will be stored and delivered once they create an account with the provided email. Users can also choose to send content anonymously.

## Features

- **No Account Required:** Send content (title, description, and image) without registering.
- **Email-based Sharing:** Share content with people who donâ€™t have accounts. They will receive the content once they sign up using the email address you shared content with.
- **Anonymous Sharing:** Option to send content anonymously.
- **User Inbox & Outbox:** Registered users can view their received and sent content in the inbox and outbox, respectively.

## Technologies Used
